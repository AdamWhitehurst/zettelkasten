# Bwonsamdi
[[Loa]] of spirits of the dead, primarily [[Trolls]]. His temple is the [[Necropolis]] in [[Nazmir]]. As of a deal with the King [[Rastakhan]], Bwonsamdi is currently the highest loa in the [[Zandalari]] pantheon and the patron loa of the royal family.

## Shadows Rising
Bwonsamdi was responsible for thwarting the assasination attempt on Queen [[Talanji]]'s life. He secretly pushed [[Zekhan]] into the would-be assassin servent, causing the Wretchweed poison to spill.

Later, when Talanji wants to speak to her father, Bwomsamdi tells her he won't, "You cant control me and I cant control you." At this time, he has not admitted whether he truly has that power or not.
