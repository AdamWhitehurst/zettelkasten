# Loss of Religious Morals
[[Jordan Peterson]] points to the 20th century rejection of religious myths (as moral guidance) as the reason why [[Communism]] rose to power: As a way to fill that moral void

>It is evident that pure abstract rationality, ungrounded by tradition--the kind seen in Soviet style communism--is unable to determine and make explicit what it is that should guide individual and social behavior. They cannot sustain themselves and do not produce the results they promise. 
Perhaps it is because the intelligently planned systems fail to account for the irrational, often ridiculous aspect of human nature.
If we take the risk and admit our ignorance, we could analyze the religious body of text --that is centrally and properly concerned with the nature of successful human existence--to determine that essence of human motivation and morality.
