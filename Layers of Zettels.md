# Layers of Zettels
Having a hierarchy of [[Zettel|zettels]] provides a level of [[Zettelkasten Organization|organization]] to a [[Zettelkasten]].

## Bottom Layer: Content Notes
These are the typical Zettel notes, composed of information about the topic, linked to other Zettels but hyperlinks and tags.

At this level, tags are very important to form new connections.

## Middle Layer: Structure Notes
These are essentially a table of contents for your content notes:

These notes provide several benefits:
- Give you an overview of a topic 
- Create hierarchies of notes
- Provide a hub for information

Structure notes and tags are similar in that they both point to a set of notes. Structure notes add structure as well.

Structure notes allow for organization of notes in a non-linear, decentralized way, avoiding the pitfalls of [[Folgezettel]].

## Top Layer: Main Structure Notes and Double Hashes
At some point, the need arises for Structure notes that point to sets of other structure notes. These Structure-pointing Structure notes are the top layer, as they are the tip of the iceberg that is you zettelkasten.

It is useful to mark these notes with a special double-hashtag, like `##programming`, for quickly finding them.

>My structure note on human movement is a perfect example of it. First, I wrote a lot about training. The training structure note linked to strength training, endurance training, sprint training, strongman training, mobility training, and more. But after a while a couple of topics didnâ€™t fit into this space. What about physical work like wood chopping or the whole space of non-movement (like chronic sitting)? The topic broadened and I found a new umbrella: Human Movement. This structure note just keeps on floating on top. It is like the tip of an iceberg. No matter how much water freezes and is added to its body, the top stays on top.

>Another type of top-level structure notes are the one I design in this manner right away. I worked a lot on the topic of self-worth from various perspectives (even from the perspective of cardinal sins; the perspective is broad!). The structure note is tagged with a special tag: ##self-worth. If I search for #self-worth (note the single hash!) I get all the notes that deal with this concept but with a double hash I go directly where the money is in my archive: The top-level structure note. 

## Note on Folders
Folders should not be used in zettelkasten as this is a method of avoiding structure within your system, and it encapsulates ideas apart from one another, limiting the interdisciplinary connection that a zettelkasten is meant to produce.
