# Perception
The identification, organization, and interpretation of [[Sensation|sensory information]].

According to [[Andrew Huberman]], perception is "all about which [[Sensation]]s we are conscious of." The difference between sensation and perception has consequences in different contexts: 
	When we are calm, our perception is "wide," we take in a lot of information.
	When we are alarm, or nervous, our perception is "narrow," we fixate on details.
