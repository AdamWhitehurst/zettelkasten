# 1619 Project
A [[Pulitzer Prize]]-Winning Project put forward by [[The New York Times]].

The award was given for “a sweeping, deeply reported and personal essay for the ground-breaking 1619 Project, which seeks to place the enslavement of Africans at the center of America’s story, prompting public conversation about the nation’s founding and evolution.”[^1]

[[Pulitzer Prize]]-Winning historian [[Allen C Guelzo]] has refuted three major claims of the project: [^2]
1. That the American Revolution was "motivated by the urge to protect slavery"
2. That plantation slavery was the model for modern American capitalism
3. That Abraham Lincoln was a racist; a racist who planned the deportation of black people because black people were, as they put it, 'a problem; a worrisome problem.'

### Maternal Mortality Rates

The 1619 Project uses the disparity in maternal-mortality rates between white mothers and black mothers in the United State to support its claim. However, this disparity exists in Europe as well.[^3] Conflating this statistic is that maternal-mortality rates in the United Stated are the highers among any group in the developed world, which convolutes any claim of causation since the United States' medical system differs significantly from any European nation's system.

For black women, Europe had a maternal-mortality rate of 40 in 100,000 (1 in 2,500), according to the UK Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths[^5], while the US had a rate of 56 in 100,000 (according to the Children's Institute).[^6]

Moreover, evidence is not conclusive on the cause of this claim. Maternal-mortality rates of black women is correlated with higher PTSD rate in black women, which is known to cause higher maternal and infant-mortality rates.[^4]
