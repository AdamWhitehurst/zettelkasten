# Talanji
Queen of the [[Zandalari]] Empire and daughter of God King [[Rastakhan]]. She is a priestess of the [[Loa]] [[Rezan]].

# Shadows Rising
During the first Horde Council meeting, Talanji is obnoxioius. Claiming center stage, she demands revenge for the Siege of [[Zuldazar]], but refused to listen to the demands of others, particularly [[Lilian Voss]], who brings up the unpaid revenge of the Undead.
Following a failed assassination attempt on her own life, Talanji storms out 'with head held high,' saying "[Orgrimmar does not need me,] Zuldazar will always need me." This gives one the impression of a scared child.

In her tour of the pyramid, she admits that she despises [[Jaina Proudmoore]] for killing her father, zekhan responds that "folks change," a powerful statement to her. A moment later, one guard at the door is impaled, the other guard [[Miral]] blocks Talanji, as voices chant "hunt the queen." A dozen [[Widows Bite]] rebels assault them, they fight off most but Bwonsambi arrives and takes out remaining.
