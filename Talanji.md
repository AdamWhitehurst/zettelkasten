# Talanji
Queen of the [[Zandalari]] Empire and daughter of God King [[Rastakhan]]. She is a priestess of the [[Loa]] [[Rezan]].

# Shadows Rising
During the first Horde Council meeting, Talanji is obnoxioius. Claiming center stage, she demands revenge for the Siege of [[Zuldazar]], but refused to listen to the demands of others, particularly [[Lilian Voss]], who brings up the unpaid revenge of the Undead.
Following a failed assassination attempt on her own life, Talanji storms out 'with head held high,' saying "[Orgrimmar does not need me,] Zuldazar will always need me." This gives one the impression of a scared child.
