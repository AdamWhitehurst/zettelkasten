# Battle For Azeroth Warfronts

## No PvP
![[Annotation 2020-07-26 191515.jpg]]

" - No plans to add PvP elements to Warfronts, it's a PvE experience. The main goal is to bring the good old feeling of faction warfare and RTS into the game."

"[Preach] wasn't too off-the-mark. Going back to WoW Classic, we could support *way* more players in combat using the same servers, the same underlying technology because the pace of combat was much slower, there were fewer effects going on. Today people have myuch more haste, more procs going off and the key thing is, all that information needs to be computed on the server"
