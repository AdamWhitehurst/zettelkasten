# Zettel Linking
Connecting two [[Zettel]] notes together. Links are the strongest tie between notes and fall into these categories:
- [[Hyperlinks]]
- [[Tags]]
- Full-text search, tying notes together via similar words

Each has its own benefits and costs. Full-text search is arguably the most accurate and can encompass the others (you could just search for a term and see all zettels that mention that term), but searching is mentally taxing.

Tags can become bloated over time.

Hyperlinks are dependent on what your remember to write down, and thus are incomplete connections.

## Debate
Though some argue against the need for hyperlinks or tags:
> Setting links manually is a waste of time because this links are not different from search results; in fact, they are the same. Some search has produced both the current note and the note it’s linking to in the past. A link is simply the remark that “these two things are of the same kind”. A link saves you from typing in in the search term again. That’s all.
    As a side-effect, you can ditch specialized Zettelkasten software. All writing applications support full-text search within a single file. Just put all your notes into one file which becomes a representation of the stream of your knowledge.

However, the benefits of those links are fuindamental to a zettelkasten system. As one online user wrote:
> When one creates a new note and looks for which notes to connect it too [sic], the preexisting connections between old notes lead you to more notes than you would get by memory or search alone.

Despite its reliance on memory, hyperlinking is the concerted effort needed to produce results. The act of sifting older zettels as link candidates jogs one's mind of old trails of thought that you would like to follow, and provides [[Spaced Repetition]] for free.

Moreover, linking provides [[Zettelkasten Organization]] to your zettelkasten.
