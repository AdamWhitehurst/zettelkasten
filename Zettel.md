# Zettel

The unit of a [[Zettelkasten|Zettelkasten]], composed of [[Zettel Metadata|Metadata]] and [[Zettel Content|Content]]. Zettels should be atomic. 


Make Zettels as small and succinct as possible, but not to the degree that it would hamper understanding.

Imagine you are writing the Zettel so someone else could understand. Future you will encounter the Zettel as if it's the first time.
