# Zekhan
"Zappy Boy" is a jungle [[Troll]] [[Shaman]] from the [[Echoing Isles]]. He is first seen participating in the Battle for [[Lordaeron]]. Claims to have joined the [[Horde]] and becoming a companion to [[Varok Surfang]] after hearing stories from his father.

## Shadows Rising
During the first Horde Council, Zekhan notes feeling like a shoadow to others, first his father, then to [[Thrall]]. During the meeting, while he is failing at wooing the Queen [[Talanji]], he is unknowingly pushed by [[Bwonsamdi]] into a would-be assassin, thus spoiling the attempt.
Because of his thwarting this assassination attempt, he is promoted to the [[Zuldazar]] ambassador of the Horde. He is compelled to say yes by the strong (spirit) hand of Suafang clasping him on his shoulder, despite having no confidence in himself.
[[Thrall]] and [[Rokhan]] explain their decision:
	Thrall: "Can he do it?"
    Rokhan: "I think young queen will find his presence less revolting than mine or yours."
Following this exchange, Rokhan gives Zekhan a dagger.

Later, when Bwonsamdi gives zekhan a vision of Saurfang being on Draenor with his family, Zekhan promises to influence Talanji to side with the horde.
