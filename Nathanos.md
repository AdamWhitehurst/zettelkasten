# Nathanos Blightcaller
[[Forsaken]] [[Human]] champion of [[Sylvanas]], and teacher of new Forsaken [[Hunters]].

In life, Nathanos Marris was the first and only Human "[[Ranger Lord]]" in [[Quel'Thalas]], where he met Sylvanas. He died and became [[Undead]] during the [[Third War]].

## Shadows Rising
Planned an assassination on Queen [[Talanji]] with [[Apari]] at the command of Sylvanas, accompanied by [[Lelyias]] and [[Xe'ra]] During this time, he had concerns over Xe'ra's loyalty, if it was simple bloodthirst. When [[Visrynn]] arrived with news of the assassination's failure, Nathanos hatches the plan to spread rumors that the [[Horde]] has 'lost faith in Talanji.'
