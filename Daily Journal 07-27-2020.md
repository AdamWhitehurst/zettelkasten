## Morning
##### Brain Dump
Ugh. How did I let myself do that. How did I think I could get away with that? I am better than this, and I need to start acting like it. I don't want this to be my legacy.
I guess I don't care about myself, but I feel like I've let my family down. 

I want my family to be proud.

I want to take work seriously.

I want to do awesome stuff with programming.

I want to be optimized.

I don't want this, whatever I am doing to myself right now.

##### What Would Make Today Great?
- Getting myself together ( how do I do that? )
