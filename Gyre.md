### Definition
A circular or spiral motion or form; especially: a giant cicular oceanic suface current

### Trivia
[[William Butler Yeats]] opens his 1920 poem, "[[The Second Coming]]," with this word. Often found in poetic or literary contects as an alternative to the more familiar *circle* or *spiral*.

Comes from [[Latin]] *gyrus* from the Greek *gyros* meaning *"ring"* or *"circle."*
