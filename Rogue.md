## Tips

- Stealth to avoid trash
- Aim for 100% up-time on Garrote and Rupture
- 

## Managing Bleeds
In certain situations, you must refreshing [[Garrote]] or [[Rupture]] early, like when you will lose uptime on a boss to his a different target.

Maintain poison uptime on multiple targets (you get more energy). Try to maximize numbers with [[Fan of Knives]], and use [[Poisoned Knife]] for individuals.

## Resource Usage
Make sure you do not find yourself being Energy capped or casting Combo Point generating abilities when at maximum Combo Points. Maximize [[Envenom]] windows, important in conjunction with [[Toxic Blade]]. [[Envenom]] is your primary combo point dump when [[Rupture]] does not need to be refreshed.

## Cooldowns
- [[Vendetta]] is your main DPS cooldown, be careful using it on targets that are short lived, as it is a debuff on the target rather than a personal buff.
- [[Feint]] is useful for predictable damage.
- [[Cloak of Shadows]] has a variety of uses, such as solo soaking mechanics or clearing debuffs that would force you out of melee range.
- [[Evasion]] is useful if you have to tank some adds or the boss for a few seconds.
