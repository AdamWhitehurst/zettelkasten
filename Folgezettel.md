# Folgezettel
A a specific and intended connection between Zettels, realized through their position in the archive. Arguably considered a vestige of physical zettelkasten methods, and no longer important to digital systems. 

Folgezettel translates from [[German]] to "sequence of notes."

Example:

The concept comes from [[Niklas Luhmann|Luhmann]] himself, but it is not clear whether he was a major proponent of it. He wrote that it is not important where you store a Zettel as long as you can reference it from every other point to the Zettelkasten. [1] It is not clear whether Luhmann believed the technique was fundamental to zettelkasten as a whole or if it was a consequence of him using a physical zettelkasten system. Howeevr, the ability to create [[Zettel Linking|links]] between zettels reduces the importance of Zettel sequencing.
