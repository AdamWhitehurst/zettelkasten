# Black Lives Matter Protest Accounts

### [[Joe Rogan]]
> The economy collapsing at the same time as the George Floyd protests led people to start looting. - 19:08 [^1]

>Police let them steal [censored], they were standing down in Beverly Hills and Santa Monica literally cops standing there while people were smashing doors. - 19:18 [^1] 
### [[Ben Shapiro]]
>Media coverage of this stuff is just awful. The media were cheering this stuff on and they were simulataneously making two arguments that conflict with each other. One was: 'These were mostly peaceful protests.' Mostly peaceful is the most looselyy defined, arbitrarily applied term in history. 'OJ Simpson was mostly peaceful that night' ... I've never heard this term before where a protest turns into a vast riot wrecking all of Melrose and everybody's like, well it was mostly peaceful." - 19:28 [^1]
