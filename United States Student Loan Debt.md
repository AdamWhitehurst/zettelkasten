# United States Student Loan Debt

Student loans are a problem affecting over 44 million Americans, who cumulatively owe more than $1.6 trillion in debt. While critics claim that this issue is a matter of poor responsibility on the borrower's (student's) part, student loans are unlike normal loans in very meaningful ways:
- The Dept.of Education decides loan servicers (like Navient) for borrowers, there is no competition between servicers.
- Loans are given to young adults, even children under 18, without the borrower's full understanding of what these loans imply, nor their options for repayment.
- Loan Servicers like Navient have a history of misleading borrowers
	- They push borrowers into repayment plans that cost the borrowers--in some cases--10's of thousands of dollars in unnecessary interest
	- Students trying to find best option to repay loan call their loan servicers' support and are misinformed. Often the students are told to go into loan forebearance, instead of an income-based repayment plan 

The issue of blame is not also a matter of irresponsible lending. Young adults in the US are heavily pressured to go to college in the first place.

Is there really an option for us not to take a loan?" Two-thirds of jobs in America require some degree.
- Chairwoman Maxine Waters' tuition at CalState LA in 1971 was the equivalent of about $1000 a year, which today costs over $6000
	- Over 110% increase since 1970, while inflation has only gone up 16%
