# Zettelkasten Organization
The way in which [[Zettel|Zettels]] are [[Zettel Content|laid out]] and the way they are interlinked and grouped. 

## Interlinking
Specialized Zettels, called [[Layers of Zettels|Structure Zettels]] are often used to provide a level of organization to a Zettelkasten.

*A series of Zettels (nodes) connected by links (edges). Though it appears that this is a mess of interconnected nodes, this is indeed what we want!*

Zettelkastens' ability to generate serendipitous connections and stimulate new ideas is due to the massive interconnected network of nodes. Compare the above, more realistic example, to some example [[neural network]]s:

Much the same as Neural Networks, the way in which Zettels are connected has a profound impact on the ideas it generates. The details of how these different connection schemes affect a Zettelkasten is currently unknown.

## Grouping
![[Zettelkasten Tags.png]]

Zettels are grouped using `tags` and other [[Zettel Metadata|Metadata]]. This is useful for when one needs to filter the set of all possible ideas down, in order to simplify the lens of ideas they are considering or provide a good starting-point on an idea journey.

One must be aware that one may encounter this point-of-entry problem with tags too. One can avoid this by having strict criteria for what a tag can be.

When thinking of tags, ask yourself: *"This note is about X, Y, Z"*
