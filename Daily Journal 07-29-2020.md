## Morning
##### Brain Dump
*Just type what you're thinking*
WEIGHTS PLS SHIP I WANT TO LIST YOU NAO

Swimming is really becoming a drag. It's tough to get myself to start like that in the morning.

I found a neat YouTube channel that I'm going to digest: https://www.youtube.com/c/CurtisMcHaleG
His information is pleasantly straightforward, unpolished. I guess just pure? His two book recommendations are now top of my priority list:
[[How to Read Book]]
[[Taking Smart Notes]]

I also want to look into markdown parsing techniques.

##### What Would Make Today Great?
 *List 1 to 3 items that--if completed--would deem today a success*
 - a good presentation to Business
 - time to explore Curtis McHale's YT
 - Mapping Jira stories to project
 

##### Improvements from Yesterday
*Reference Yesterday's "Things to Improve" Section*
"Sticking with habits," because I was feeling a bit disconnected from my Notion Database. I don't want to let one or the other slip by the wayside.

##### Word Connections
[[Whinge]] <--- !!!!
[[Pejorative]]

## Evening
##### Today's Successes
*Note what went right today*

##### Things to Improve
*Note things you can do better tomorrow*

##### Am I Resisting Something?
*Note any mental friction you experienced*

##### Favorite Zettel from Today
[[]]

##### Story from Today
*Tell a short story (good or bad) from today, or make up a fictional one.*
