## Black Discrimination in United States
- When whites left blacks "on their own" in Detroit is when crime rates spiked and blacks fell behind socioeconomically.
- To restore equality for impoverished and discriminated communities:
	1. Restore police force, to eliminate crime
	2. Establish social institutions (like churches) to increase social investment
	3. Businesses will want to invest only when they feel it is safe [^1]

## Police Discrimination
- "Police union contracts protect a lot of bad cops." Designed to protect members of the union
- Qualified Immunity is overreaching. Protects police from civil liability when precise, hyper-narrow situation has not occurred before (knee-on-neck vs. knee-on-upper-shoulder)
- Need a registry of police who have required disciplinary action against them
