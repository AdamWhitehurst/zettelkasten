# FSD Front-end Development: Testing Tools

## Javascript Testing Environment
![[Pasted image 31.png]]
1. [[Unit Tests]] - Test atomic **units** of code:  classes, functions, methods
2. [[Integration Tests]] - Test **connections between** atomic units
3. [[Functional Tests]] - End-to-End testing

### Parts of Testing Environment
![[Pasted image 32.png]]
1. Test Runners - Applications or functions that run tests
2. Assertion Functions - Test you code to assert they function as expected
3. Test Logger - Logs test results, which failed and passed
4. Spies - Inspect side effects, mocks, and the way you code is used by itself
5. Browser Controllers - Mock the browser environment and simulate users, like [[React Testing Library]], or [[Selenium]]

Testing Frameworks implement one or more of these parts. For instance, [[Jest]] is our runner, assertion library, and logger.
