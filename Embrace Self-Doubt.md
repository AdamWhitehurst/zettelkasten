# Embrace Self-Doubt
> "Tell me. Tell me. Tell me if I ever did a thing. Tell me if anything was ever made." - Leonardo DaVinci's Journal [^1]

We must learn not to fear self-doubt but to embrace it as a normally occurring opportunity for growth and improved performance.

As 'our own worst critics,' we have potential for great things, if we embrace the criticism constructively. Do not ignore this critic, utilize it. 

##### The first steps
- Become aware of when you are currently having self-doubting thoughts
    - Typical thoughts: “I can’t do this. I do not deserve this. I’m not good enough"
- Observe what triggers self-doubting thoughts to arise

##### Trust your instincts. Be decisive
[[Malcolm Gladwell]] explains that our delayed instinct is to second-gess ourselves and our abilities. 
> “The first task of Blink is to convince you of a simple fact: decisions made very quickly can be every bit as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately.”

Acting before self-doubt sets in empowers you to build your 'instinct muscle'.
