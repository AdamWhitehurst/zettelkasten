# Existential Angst
![[Pasted image 30.png]]
The feeling of dread or hopelessness that we (humans) experience when faced with the [[Absurd (Existentialism)|Absurd]]. 

This feeling follows the realization that the world is utterly without meaning and that humans are terrifyingly free to redefine what it is to be human. That realization is known as the "[[Existential Epiphany]]."

The heart of this idea comes from the question of "existence" vs. "essence." Essence meaning a template, blueprint, or standard. Essence defines what we *ought* to be. In contrast, Existence is what we *are*, based purely on what he or she has done.

[[Existentialism|Existentialists]] agree that "[[Jean-Paul Sartre#Existence Precedes Essence|existence precedes essence]]." In other words, historical descriptions of "humanity" carry no value in defining what hmans might or should become. We are free to redefine ourselves. Moreover, this means that we are constantly redefining ourselves whether we mean to or not. This leaves us a massive responsibility of properly defining what it means to be human, with no feedback or validation.

The understanding of that terrifyingly exihilerating responsibility is Existential Angst.
