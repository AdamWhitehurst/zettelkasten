# Thrall
Former warchief of the [[Horde]]. Left the Horde following the events of [[Legion]], due to internal guilt over his handling of the Horde and fighting [[Garrosh]]. He and his family retired to Nagrand during the events of [[Battle for Azeroth]].

During this time, Thrall felt the Burning of [[Teldrassil]]. Later, [[Surfang]] come to [[Nagrand]] and begs Thrall to return, not as warchief however. This meeting is interrupted by Dark Ranger assassins. Thrall reluctantly agrees.

## Shadows Rising
Thrall's return to Orgrimmar is tense. He is unsure how to be a part of the War Council without becoming the leader, while realizing he must be the one to restore order.
