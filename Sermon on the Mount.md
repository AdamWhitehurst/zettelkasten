# Sermon on the Mount
The longest continuous discourse of [[Jesus Christ]] found in the [[New Testament]], recorded by [[Matthew]] (Chapters 5, 6, and 7). 

It is a collection of sayings and teachings of Jesus Christ, which focus on the Lord's Prayer as well as the [[Beatitudes]]. Quoted in this discourse literally describe how to live a life pleasing to God and the characteristics of Christian discipleship, but are also more generally applicable to living a meaningful, moral life. 

This sermon takes place relatively early in the Ministry of Jesus after he has been baptized by [[John the Baptist]] and has been one of the most widely quoted.
