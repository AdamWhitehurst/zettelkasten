# Andrew Huberman
Andrew Huberman is a neroscientist and tenuresd professor in the Department of Nerobiology at Stanford University of Medicine.

He primarily concerns himself with how the [[Human]] [[Nervous System]] controls our other bodily activities. He claims there are five major responsibilities for the nervous system:
- [[Sensation]]
- [[Perception]]
- [[Emotion]]
- [[Thought]]
- [[Action]]

Huberman claims that "body states" and "states of mind" are essential to understanding how the brain works. The connection between mind and body is within the Autonomic nervous system (See [[Nervous System]])
