## Morning
##### Brain Dump
Yesterday was the first day that I felt like I had gotten rolling with my Zettelkasten. Today I hope to continue that, and improve on it.

I need to be able to open up more free space as well, I think that will simply just come with time, however.

My gym sure is happy to take forever, but I really shouldn't complain. Im not happy with the pool area idea anymore, I'd much rather just put it in the garage.


##### What Would Make Today Great?
- More creative ideas to connect Zettelkasten and Notion
- Brewing booch
 

##### Improvements from Yesterday
- Not taking detours (overriding css styling for an hour)

##### Word Connections
[[Anfractuous]]
[[Epistolary]]
