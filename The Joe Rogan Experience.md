==TODO:== fill out this zettel. MOAR STATS

## Impact
In January 2015, the podcast was listened to by more than 11 million people.

This podcast ranked highest in a May 2019 [[Coleman Insights]] study among 1000 18-to-64-year-old participants in the category of "unaided awareness." The participants were asked to: "name as many podcasts as they could think of, regardless of whether they listen to them."


(OPINIONATED) The Joe Rogan Experience became an "unlikely political influencer" in the 2020 presidential election after presidential candidates [[Andrew Yang]] and [[Tulsi Gabbard]] both saw measurable surges in popularity and fundraising after making guest appearances on the program in 2019, and in 2020, when presidential candidate [[Bernie Sanders]] saw a surge of press coverage in national news and global media outlets as a result of his campaign using a clip from The Joe Rogan Experience showing Rogan speaking favorably about the candidate and saying on air, "I think I'll probably vote for Bernie."
