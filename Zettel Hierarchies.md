# Zettel Hierarchies
[[Zettel]] hierarchies produce [[Zettelkasten Organization|order]]. Without order, your [[Zettelkasten]] will become an opaque ocean of unconnected thoughts. 

The need for order manifests itself through various questions:
- How do I find related zettels to [[Zettel Linking|place meaningful links]]?
- If new ideas, topics , and thoughts emrge, how can I access them?
- How can I get an overview on topic X in my zettelkasten?
- How can I make sure that I integrate my zettel well enough by linking to the right places?
