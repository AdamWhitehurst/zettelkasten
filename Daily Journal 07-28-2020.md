## Morning
##### Brain Dump
Doing better today. Typing was rough, I need to be kind to myself, though, and accept that I cannot tyrannize myself into doing better, I just have to keep putting in concerted effort.

I found a nice recipe for french press coffee:

        ~21 g Coffee (Medium, Kona-style, Italian)
        1/2 tsp Lion's mane
        1/2 tsp Cordyceps
- Coarse-ish grind
- Just-under-boiling water, fill enough water that coffee freely floats.
- Stir for 20 seconds
- Fill rest of water
- Press plunger slowly

##### What Would Make Today Great?
 - Mapping Jira work to Notion
 - Integrating MCBot with Ruin channel
 - Working thru JS Badge work
 - Working thru personal learning
 

##### Improvements from Yesterday
- More Exercise
- More Water
- Completing tasks

##### Word Connections
