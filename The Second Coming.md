# "The Second Coming"
"The Second Coming" is a poem written in 1919 by [[William Butler Yeats]]. It was first printed in *The Dial*, in November 1920, but also included in later collections.

The poem uses [[Christian]] imagery regarding the Apocalypse and Second Coming (of [[God]]) to reflect the post-war atmosphere of Europe following the [[First World War]].

It is also referenced in [[Jordan Peterson]]'s book, "[[12 Rules for Life]]," to convey the idea of chaos gathering itself up to wreak havoc as somone spirals out of control due to their own ignorance of the [[Truth]].

> Turning and turning in the widening gyre
> The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
> Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
> Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
> The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
> The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
> The best lack all conviction, while the worst
> Are full of passionate intensity.

> Surely some revelation is at hand;
> Surely the Second Coming is at hand.
> The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out
> When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi
> Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert
> A shape with lion body and the head of a man,
> A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,
> Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it
> Reel shafows of the indignant desert birds.
> The darkness drops again; but now I know
> That twenty centrues of stony sleep 
> Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,
> And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,
> Slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?
