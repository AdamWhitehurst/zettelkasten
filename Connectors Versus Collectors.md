# Connectors Versus Collectors
A pattern that [[Zettelkasten]] managers fall into of collecting information, rather than connecting information to existing knowledge, as their zettelkasten grows. 

This habit defeats the purpose of the zettelkasten system, as only through connecting ideas and information do we spark new ideas and curiosity.

That is why the emphasis of a zettelkasten is to create; whether that is produce articles, videos, programs. If your zettelkasten does not produce fruits, it is lacking a vital nutrient. Zettelkastens are fed by connections, not information.
