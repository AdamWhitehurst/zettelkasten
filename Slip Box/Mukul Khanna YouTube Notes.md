==You don't rise to the level of your goals, you follow to the level of your systems.==
*- James Clear "Atomic Habits"*

## Learning
1. Learning involves:
	- Reading
	- Thinking
	- Writing
	- Connecting
	- Organizing
	- Developing Ideas
 1. "By explicitly writing down how something connects or leads to something else, we force ourself to clarify and distingusih ides from each other."
 1. Paraphrasing forces you to understand it on some level, just to describe it
 1. "Learning is not about saving information, but about building connections and bridges betweeen pieces of information."
 	- A note is just saved information, linking and tagging that note to your other notes forms the connections
 	- Try to fit notes to notes in different contexts
 	- We learn better by comparin, contrasting, and integrating information into different contexts

## Active Notetaking
1. When you come across something interesting, note it.
	- "By noting to remember and reflect upon it later, you can allow yourself to forget it now focus on the task at hand." - David Allen "Getting Things Done"
1. These notes are rough--not intended to be evergreen--to be assimilated into zettelkasten later
1. Save important information sooner, format later

## Slip-Notes
- "The slip-box is designed to present you wioth ideas you have already forgotten, allowing your brain to focus on thinking instead of remembering"
- Write Slip-notes about:
	1. What the idea is and how it relates to your study
	1. "What about the information I wrote down piqued my interest?"
	1. Note questions as well! Open lines of inquiry in the subject
 - When your zettelkasten gets big, keep an eye on it when making new Zettels. This helps you connect new to old.
 
## Get Started and Make It a Habit
 - Don't worry about the details, just start and correct as you go. You will learn what the optimal process is only by practicing it.

 ## Turning Notes into Zettels
1. Attach links and tags to notes
1. Weed out poor notes by comparing to older notes in connected zettels
