## Morning
##### Brain Dump
*Just type what you're thinking*
Well that sure lasted. A whole two days? Im ashamed. Again.

I must normalize. Literally, clean myself up and get on some more positive habits. I will.

Imagine how my family would react if I came to them, admitting again, that I've let myself fall into this habit. I think they are simply living in denial at the moment, and that is a very thin, glass veil of denial indeed. I just want to be plain with someone.

Imagine all the things I could accomplish. If I got control of myself and focus on what was meaningful, not what is expedient...
