# Rendering Markdown in JavaScript
In the context of [[JavaScript]], clientside rendering is the typical strategy of rendering [[Markdown]], despite it's subefficiency.

A consideration when rending markdown into [[HTML]] is the debug process. [[React]] has a powerful debugging suite, but rendered markdown is not a part of the debuggable portion of code.

[[React-Markdown|react-markdown]] package claims to provide a system for rendering markdown into React HTML as well as a good developer experience.
