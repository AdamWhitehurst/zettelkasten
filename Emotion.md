# Emotion
Biological states associated with the [[Nervous System]] brought on by neurophysiological changes variously associated with [[Thought|thoughts]] and [[Feeling|feelings]] ([[Sensation|sensations]]).

According to [[Andrew Huberman]], emotions are "brain-body states." [[Perception]] influences our emotions.
