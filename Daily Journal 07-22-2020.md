## Morning
##### Brain Dump
I really like how the Notion + Obsidian coordination is coming along. There are still a lot of questions left open. The more I can offset into Obsidian markdown, the better. Im really excited to set up a markdown parser to do data analysis.

##### What Would Make Today Great?
- Adding knowledge to my Zettelkasten from any sources
- Completing oppDNA work on FlightPlan

##### Improvements from Yesterday
- There is no yesterday, today is the first day of a new chapter in my life

##### Word Connections
[[Fungible|Fungible]]
[[Requisite|Requisite]]

*Note things you can do better tomorrow*

##### Am I Resisting Something?
*Note any mental friction you experienced*
 - Adding more Zettels, due to template

##### Favorite Zettel from Today
[[Requisite]] - I like the template for words. How do I connect words better tho?

##### Story from Today
*Tell a short story (good or bad) from today, or an event that made an impression on you, or make up a fictional one.*
I was happy to get the Ruin roster management project set up. I plan to use it on a cylclical basis, and will experiment with that going forward. If this approach works, I may make more cyclic projects.
