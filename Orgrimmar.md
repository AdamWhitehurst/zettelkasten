# Orgrimmar
Capital city of the [[Orcs]] as well as the [[Horde]]. Found at the northern edge of [[Durotar]].

## Shadows Rising
The first horde council meeting (which saw the return of [[Thrall]] from [[Nagrand]]) was derailed by an assassination attempt on [[Talanji]]. This assassination was thwarted by [[Zekhan]], who was unknowingly pushed by [[Bwonsamdi]].

Immediately preceeding the assassination attempt, Talanji and [[Lilian Voss]] were arguing over where to send Horde forces: To take revenge for the Siege of [[Zuldazar]], or to take back [[Lordaeron]].
