## Morning
##### Brain Dump
I really like how the Notion + Obsidian coordination is coming along. There are still a lot of questions left open. The more I can offset into Obsidian markdown, the better. Im really excited to set up a markdown parser to do data analysis.

##### What Would Make Today Great?
- Adding knowledge to my Zettelkasten from any sources
- Completing oppDNA work on FlightPlan

##### Improvements from Yesterday
- There is no yesterday, today is the first day of a new chapter in my life

##### Word Connections
[[Fungible|Fungible]]
[[Requisite|Requisite]]
